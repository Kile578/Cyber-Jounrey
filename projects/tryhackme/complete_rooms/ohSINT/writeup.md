# OSINT LAB WRITEUP

[Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/room/ohsint)

## Overview
***OSINT*** (Open Source Intelligence) is the process of gathering information from public sources via the internet to help analyze threats and make informed decisions.

### Pros
1. **Educational Purpose**: Help researchers, students, and journalists find topics that are reliable and educational in a more efficient way
2. **Credibility**: It is a great way to show skills and open doors professionally
3. **Safety**: Conduct OSINT on yourself and see where your information is available and make an effort to get rid of it

### Cons
If it can be used for good, it means it can be used for bad and turned against you.
1. **Malicious Use**: Techniques can be used to do the opposite of safety and make it dangerous for people, which can cause stalking, harassment, and other harmful activities
2. **Changing Landscape**: With all things computer-related, the landscape is always changing

## Learning Objectives

### **Image Analysis & Metadata**
1. **Extract Image Metadata** - Use ExifTool to reveal hidden information in image files (copyright, GPS coordinates, creation data)
2. **Analyze Visual Content** - Examine images for clues and identifying information

### **Username Intelligence**
3. **Cross-Platform Investigation** - Track usernames across multiple platforms (Twitter, GitHub, WordPress)
4. **Social Media Profiling** - Gather information from social media profiles and posts

### **Network Intelligence**
5. **BSSID/SSID Investigation** - Use network identifiers to determine physical locations
6. **Wigle.net Usage** - Leverage WiFi mapping databases for geolocation

### **Email & Contact Discovery**
7. **Email Enumeration** - Find personal email addresses through various online sources
8. **Contact Information Correlation** - Link contact details across different platforms

### **Web Investigation**
9. **Source Code Analysis** - Examine webpage source code for hidden information
10. **Hidden Content Discovery** - Find concealed text using selection techniques and color manipulation

### **OSINT Correlation**
11. **Information Synthesis** - Combine data from multiple sources to build a complete profile
12. **Timeline Construction** - Track a person's activities and locations over time
